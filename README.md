# python-api-challenge
For this challenge, I followed prof instructions on class work as well as homework review, homework solution and virtual assistant like openAI.
Summary
In this challenge, we used python API and JSON, a) to visualize weather condition over 500 cities across the globe and b) to locate cities and hotel based on the weather condition using geoViews python library and Geoapify API . Python code was used to compare weather varaibles (Temperature, Humidity, wind speed and cloudiness) with latitude coordaintes of the cities. Scatter plot and linear regression analysis was used to visulaize the data. 
The linear regression analysis for latitude with temperature showed that latitude is correlated with temperature in both northern and southern hemisphere such that at temperature was warmer near zero degree latitude in both northern and southern hemisphere. 
Strong correlation is not found for latitude with humidity, cloudiness and wind speed in both hemisphere.
For the vacationpy challenge, we used the cities dataframe exported from the openweatherAPI in the first challenge and mapped the cities and locate nearby hotel using Geoapify API. Map plot was used to visualize the map with hovering feature to locate the hotel.
